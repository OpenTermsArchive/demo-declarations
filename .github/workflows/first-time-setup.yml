          Hi @${{ github.actor }}! ðŸ‘‹
            
          Congratulations for starting a new Open Terms Archive collection! ðŸ˜ƒ
          
          To finish setting up your collection and start tracking, just follow these steps:

          - [ ] Wait for the first GitHub Action to [finish running](https://github.com/${{ github.repository }}/actions) so that your collection is customised.
          - [ ] Deploy on your server automatically by editing the [\`deployment\`](https://github.com/${{ github.repository }}/blob/main/deployment/) files ([documentation](https://docs.opentermsarchive.org/deployment/how-to/deploy/)).
          - [ ] Create a \`declarations\` directory and start declaring terms ([documentation](https://docs.opentermsarchive.org/terms/tutorials/track/#step-2-create-the-service-declaration)).

          To share the good news about your new collection, or if you need any additional support, [join the Open Terms Archive community chat](https://docs.opentermsarchive.org/community/how-to/join-community-chat/)! Weâ€™d love to hear from you ðŸ˜Š

          â€” @OpenTermsArchive

          Following #1, if this collection tracks terms properly, it would be great to make it discoverable and interconnected by adding it to the @OpenTermsArchive federation!

          You can learn more about the [benefits](https://docs.opentermsarchive.org/federation/benefits/) and [criteria](https://docs.opentermsarchive.org/federation/reference/criteria/) for joining the federation on the official documentation.

          When you are ready:

          - [ ] Update the [\`metadata.yml\`](https://github.com/${{ github.repository }}/blob/main/metadata.yml) file ([documentation](https://docs.opentermsarchive.org/collections/reference/metadata/)).
          - [ ] [Apply](https://docs.opentermsarchive.org/federation/how-to/join/) to join the federation.

          If you have any questions or need any support, [join the Open Terms Archive community chat](https://docs.opentermsarchive.org/community/how-to/join-community-chat/)!

          - [ ] Start by crediting @${{ github.actor }} in this issue.
